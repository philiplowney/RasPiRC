# RasPiRC
An Internet Remote-Control Car based on a Raspberry Pi &amp; 2-Channel R/C car &amp; A Pololu Maestro

### Work in Progress
This is an evolving little creation, but I'm blogging most steps here: <http://musingsofabuilder.blogspot.ie/>

## Materials Needed
* A 2-Channel Remote Control Car, using Servos and/or ESC
* A Raspberry Pi
* A Servo Controller from Pololu - I got mine here: <https://www.pololu.com/product/1350>
* Some way to supply a steady five volts to the Pi - I'm using a buck-boost regulator, which I got here: <https://www.pololu.com/product/2574>
